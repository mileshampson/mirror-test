# mirror-test

Demonstrates commits to a gitlab repository are being mirrored to github.
<p>
The gitlab public key can be temporarily added to github authorized users, github added as a remote, and a gitlab 
post-receive server hook checking the branch revisions and pushing them to the remote should really be added.
<p>
If you are seeing this text in github, this is in fact possible!
