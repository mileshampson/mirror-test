# mirror-test

Demonstrates that commits to a gitlab repository can be mirrored to github.
<p>
The gitlab public key can be temporarily added to github authorized users, github added as a remote, and a gitlab 
post-receive server hook checking the branch revisions and pushing them to the remote should be added.

DOn't commit me!
